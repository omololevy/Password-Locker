## Problem Statement.
On Average, a person has at least 7 different accounts he or she has signed into, be it email, social media, entertainment or job portal accounts. It becomes really hard to remember all those passwords and even create new ones.
</br>


## Requirements
With this App, the users will be able to:
* Create a password locker account with their details, a login username and password.
* Store their already existing account credentials in the application. Assuming they already have a twitter account, they want to store their already existing twitter username and password in the application.
* Create new account credentials in the application. For example, if they have not yet signed up for Instagram, they would want to create a credentials account for Instagram in the application and the application generates a password for them to use when they sign up for Instagram.
* Have the option of putting in a password that they want to use for the new credential account. For example, when creating their Instagram credential account, they want to have an option of putting in the password they want to use instead of having the application generate a password for them.
* View their various account credentials and their passwords in the application.
* Delete a credentials account that they no longer need in the application.
